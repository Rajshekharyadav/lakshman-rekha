We are building a Predictive AI Safety Net designed to protect vulnerable communities by using data to forecast future risks and prevent danger before it happens.

Our system primarily focuses on three key areas:

Women Safety and Empowerment

Disaster Management

Farmer Support and Agricultural Forecasting

System Workflow
Data and AI Model

We use large datasets to train a predictive AI model that runs in the backend.

This model analyzes risk patterns and forecasts potential threats related to women’s safety, disasters, and agriculture.

User Interface & Framework

The system starts with an authentication page for user login and sign-up.

Once authenticated, the user creates a profile and grants location access for accurate predictions.

Home Page Layout

The homepage is divided into sections:

A hero image slider displaying government schemes, alerts, and danger zone notifications.

Three main buttons:

Women Safety & Empowerment

Disaster Management

Farmers Section

1. Women Safety & Empowerment Section
This section has two major features:

a) Government Schemes
The page lists all women-related schemes (from the provided dataset) in an organized grid layout.

Each scheme card includes:

Eligibility criteria

“Apply Now” button

Clicking on the button redirects the user to the official government website to apply for that scheme.

b) Risk Area Information
A map is integrated that marks high-risk or crime-prone zones in red, based on the provided dataset.

If a user enters a red zone, the system sends a real-time notification saying:

“You are in a Danger Zone. Are you Safe?”

Two options appear: Safe / Not Safe.

If the user ignores the alert, a 30-second emergency alarm will play.

If the alarm is stopped within 30 seconds → Normal.

If not stopped → It automatically triggers an SOS emergency call from the user’s phone.

2. Disaster Management Section
This section provides two key options:

Current Weather Forecast – Fetches real-time weather data using an external API.

Risk Mapping – Uses both live weather data and our dataset to mark disaster-prone zones (floods, storms, droughts, etc.) on a map with visual alerts.

3. Farmers Section
This section is focused on agricultural intelligence and farmer support. It includes:

a) Fertile Land & Crop Recommendation
Displays data (initially for Punjab) showing which districts have the most fertile land.

Suggests the best crops to grow based on:

Soil fertility

Profitability

3-month weather forecast predictions

b) Crop Disease Detection
A feature that detects plant or leaf diseases using image recognition.

Users can upload a photo of the leaf, and the system will identify possible diseases and suggest remedies.

(You mentioned you’ll provide the detection code for this part.)

Data Sources
The entire system will fetch data from uploaded CSV and PDF datasets.

This data will be dynamically integrated into the model and UI for real-time analysis and updates.

Conclusion
The Predictive AI Safety Net acts as an intelligent safety infrastructure for communities by:

Predicting potential threats

Protecting individuals through real-time alerts and automation

Empowering users with access to verified government schemes and location-based safety insights
